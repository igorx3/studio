- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#4390DF) to represent trust and efficiency in delivery services.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), offering a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF7733), providing a dynamic and energetic call to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for a modern and neutral look that is suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use a set of consistent, professional icons from a library like FontAwesome or Material Design to represent different functionalities within the application. Ensure icons are intuitive and match the action they represent.
- Design the layout with a clear and responsive grid system. Focus on a mobile-first approach for the Courier portal, ensuring readability and easy interaction on smaller devices.
- Implement subtle animations for state changes, transitions, and feedback actions. For example, a loading animation when data is fetched, or a confirmation animation when an order status is updated.
